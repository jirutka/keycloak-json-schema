= JSON schemas for Keycloak

This project provides JSON schemas for the Keycloak realm export format.
The schemas are extracted from the https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/latest/rest-api/index.html#_openapi_definitions[OpenAPI definitions], corrected, extended and enriched with titles and descriptions extracted from the Admin UI message bundle (see link:patches/[]).
The aim is to use this schema to validate a realm export.

You can find the JSON schemas in https://jirutka.github.io/keycloak-json-schema/.

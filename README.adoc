= JSON schemas for Keycloak

https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] does not provide a JSON schema for the realm export format.
Fortunately, https://github.com/DAHAG-ArisNourbakhsh[Aris Nourbakhsh (DAHAG AG)] has written a tool https://github.com/dahag-ag/keycloak-openapi[keycloak-openapi] that scrapes the Keycloak source code to generate an OpenAPI definition.
It’s not perfect, there are a few bugs in the model definitions, but they’re link:bin/convert[easy to fix].
This project fixes the model definitions and converts them into a modular JSON schema that you can use directly to validate a realm export.

You can find the JSON schemas in https://jirutka.github.io/keycloak-json-schema/.
